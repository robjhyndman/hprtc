Membership remains the main source of income for the club.  It also forms the basis of our sense of community.  Long term access to the club can only be gained through membership.  The committee works very hard to ensure the fees for membership remain affordable and sustainable for the club.

Memberships are annual and apply from July 1st to June 30th.
