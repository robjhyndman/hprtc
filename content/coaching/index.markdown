One of the key strengths of a club is its coaches.  HE Parker prides itself on selecting great coaches who can instruct, encourage and improve our junior competition teams but also provide assistance on tennis technique for all of our members, regardless of age, gender, physical ability, fitness or experience.  We are delighted to have the services of Ben Longridge as our head coach.
