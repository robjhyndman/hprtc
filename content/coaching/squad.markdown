# Squad Coaching






	
  * For more advanced juniors.

	
  * There is an emphasis on fitness, rallying and match tactics in these sessions.

	
  * There is an effort made to ensure there is a low coach-player ratio and squads run longer than junior lessons, with the aim of challenging the players.
